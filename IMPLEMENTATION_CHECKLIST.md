# üöÄ Implementation Checklist - Revolutionary Expansion

## **PHASE 1: Enhanced Synthesis Mastery** ‚ö°
*Current Priority - Week 1-2*

### **Immediate Tasks (This Week)**:
- [ ] **Create Guitar Synthesis Preset**
  - [ ] Test `sawtooth + distortion + delay + dynamic filtering`
  - [ ] Add vibrato and string bending simulation
  - [ ] Create clean vs distorted variations

- [ ] **Create Saxophone Synthesis Preset**  
  - [ ] Test `sine/triangle blend + vibrato + room`
  - [ ] Add breath noise and expression
  - [ ] Create alto vs tenor variations

- [ ] **Create String Section Preset**
  - [ ] Test `triangle + slow attack + reverb + chorus`
  - [ ] Add bowing simulation and legato
  - [ ] Create violin, viola, cello variations

- [ ] **Update Claude Prompts**
  - [ ] Add synthesis preset instructions
  - [ ] Include realistic instrument emulation techniques
  - [ ] Test with various musical styles

### **Testing & Validation**:
- [ ] Generate 10+ examples using new presets
- [ ] A/B test against current synthesis

## **PHASE 2: Sample Infrastructure** üèóÔ∏è
*Week 3-4*

### **Backend Development**:
- [ ] **Create Sample Server Endpoints**
  - [ ] `GET /api/samples` - List available samples
  - [ ] `GET /api/samples/:category` - Category-specific samples
  - [ ] `POST /api/samples/upload` - Upload new samples
  - [ ] Sample metadata management

  - [ ] File storage structure (`/samples/instruments/...`)
  - [ ] JSON manifest generation
  - [ ] Automatic format conversion (WAV/OGG/MP3)
  - [ ] CDN integration for fast delivery

### **Sample Library Creation**:
- [ ] **Source High-Quality Samples**
  - [ ] Guitar: clean, distorted, acoustic, fingerpicked
  - [ ] Brass: trumpet, saxophone, trombone
  - [ ] Strings: violin, cello, sections
  - [ ] World instruments: sitar, gamelan, tabla

- [ ] **Organize Sample Collections**
  - [ ] Create category structure
  - [ ] Add metadata (BPM, key, tags)
  - [ ] Generate Strudel-compatible JSON files

*Month 2*

### **Upload Infrastructure**:
- [ ] **Frontend Upload Interface**
  - [ ] Drag & drop file upload
  - [ ] Progress indicators
  - [ ] Preview and metadata editing
  - [ ] Community sharing options

- [ ] **AI Analysis Pipeline**
  - [ ] Audio feature extraction
  - [ ] Tempo/key detection
  - [ ] Instrument classification
  - [ ] Quality assessment

### **Community Features**:
- [ ] **User Accounts & Profiles**

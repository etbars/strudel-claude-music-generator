# Enhanced Strudel + Claude 3.5 Music Generator: Project Plan

## Vision
Create an advanced text-to-music generator that leverages Claude 3.5 Sonnet's capabilities to produce sophisticated, reliable, and musically interesting compositions using Strudel's live coding environment.

## Core Problems to Solve
1. **Sound Reliability**: Ensure all generated code uses only available and reliable sounds
2. **Musical Sophistication**: Generate more complex and interesting musical patterns
3. **User Experience**: Create an intuitive interface for generating and refining music
4. **Error Handling**: Improve robustness when loading and playing generated code

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Sound & Pattern Library
1. **Sound Testing Framework**
   - Create a comprehensive test suite for all Strudel sounds
   - Document reliable sounds with examples
   - Build a sound compatibility layer

2. **Pattern Library Development**
   - Create a collection of verified working patterns by genre/style
   - Develop modular components (rhythm, melody, harmony, effects)
   - Test patterns for reliability across browsers

### Phase 2: Enhanced Claude Integration
1. **Multi-step Generation Process**
   - Structure generation: chord progressions, rhythmic patterns, form
   - Instrumentation: select appropriate sounds for each part
   - Effects & transformations: add musical interest
   - Final integration: combine all elements into cohesive piece

2. **Advanced Prompt Engineering**
   - Few-shot learning with high-quality examples
   - Detailed instructions on musical structure
   - Guidelines for creating interesting and complex music

### Phase 3: Interactive User Experience
1. **Refinement Interface**
   - Allow specific feedback on generated music
   - Enable iterative improvements
   - Provide musical parameter controls

2. **Visual Representation**
   - Add visualization of music structure
   - Show pattern representations
   - Help users understand the generated code

## Success Metrics
1. **Reliability**: >95% of generated code executes without errors
2. **Musical Quality**: User satisfaction ratings for generated music
3. **Complexity**: Measurable increase in pattern sophistication
4. **Performance**: Load time and responsiveness benchmarks

## Timeline
- **Week 1**: Sound testing and pattern library development
- **Week 2**: Enhanced Claude prompt engineering and integration
- **Week 3**: User interface improvements and refinement features
- **Week 4**: Testing, optimization, and documentation
